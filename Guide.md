## Creating Smoother Animations

To achieve smoother animations, ensure the following:

1. **Consistency**: Maintain the same scene, camera angle, lighting, and style across all frames.
2. **Subtle Motion**: Introduce realistic, gradual changes in wheel rotation, rider posture, and motion blur.
3. **Visual Continuity**: Avoid abrupt changes in perspective or background.

### Example Prompts for Smoother Animations

Here are improved prompts for generating a bicycle animation:

- **Frame 1**: A bicycle moving steadily on a sunny road, rider leaning slightly forward, background with light motion blur, consistent lighting and perspective.
- **Frame 2**: The bicycle slightly ahead on the same sunny road, wheels rotated slightly forward, rider's position adjusted naturally, maintaining the same background and lighting.
- **Frame 3**: The bicycle continuing forward on the sunny road, wheels rotated further, rider's posture subtly shifting, background motion blur slightly intensified to show movement.
- **Frame 4**: The bicycle advancing steadily, wheels rotated again, rider's position slightly adjusted, road perspective subtly changing while keeping the same lighting and style.
- **Frame 5**: The bicycle farther along the road, wheels rotated more, rider leaning slightly forward, background motion blur enhanced for a sense of speed.
- **Frame 6**: The bicycle nearing the end of the road segment, wheels rotated further, rider's posture subtly shifting, background and lighting remaining consistent.
- **Frame 7**: The bicycle continuing forward, wheels rotated again, rider's position slightly adjusted, road perspective subtly changing while keeping the same lighting and style.

Use these prompts with the `generate_animation.py` script to create animations with smoother transitions and improved visual quality.
